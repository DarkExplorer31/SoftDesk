            To access the Softdesk API, you must be connected, except for the <a href="{% url 'authentication_doc' %}">registration endpoint</a>.
            <br>
            However, being an authenticated user is not enough to access project data.
            <br>
            If you create a project, you become both the author and a contributor.
            <br>
            Only contributors of a project have access to GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH operations, and can also DELETE it. However, you need to be the author to add new contributors.
            <br>
            After understanding this, you can proceed to learn how to create a new project.
            <br>

        <h2>Get a Project [GET]</h2>
        <h3>Request Parameters</h3>
        <p>
            To retrieve a project, you can perform a simple GET request on this endpoint: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/project/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/project/</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to a response with status 200, you will receive all projects to which you are a contributor. However, you can also apply filtering based on the application name.
        </p>
        <p>
            - <code>application_name</code>: Desired application name.
        </p>
        <p>Ensure to provide your access token.</p>

        <p>
            If your request is successful, you will receive a 204 response, confirming that the project has been deleted with an empty response.
        </p>
